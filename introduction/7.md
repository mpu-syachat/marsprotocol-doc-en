## 7. What is the difference between Single staking & Batch staking

When selecting the number of validators to stake on the MarsProtocol, two stake modes are available: Single Staking and Batch Staking.
1.Single Staking is the staking deposit feature provided by Ethereum. If you create multiple validators simultaneously, you will need to complete the staking process manually for each validator.  
2.Batch Staking is an upgraded feature the MarsProtocol team developed based on the Ethereum official protocol. It automates the process of centrally connecting multiple validators to the official contract for staking without accessing your funds. It aims to provide you with a secure and convenient staking experience. Batch Staking has undergone top-level security audits conducted by SlowMist and has been verified by multiple institutional customers.
